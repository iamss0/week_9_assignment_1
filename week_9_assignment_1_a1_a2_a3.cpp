// Question1: Which of the following(s) is/are true about bubble sort:
// It is stable sort------------------------------------------------------------->TRUE
// It has a worst case space complexity of O(n)---------------------------------->FALSE
// It involves swapping of adjacent elements------------------------------------->TRUE
// After each iteration, the greatest element is placed at the end of the array.->TRUE

// Question2: What will the following array look like after one iteration of bubble sort [1,6,2,5,4,3].
// [1,3,2,4,5,6]
// [1,2,3,4,5,6]
// [1,2,5,4,3,6] THIS IS THE CORRECT ANSWER
// [1,2,4,5,3,6]

// Question3: In which case does bubble sort works in the most efficient way:
// When the array is sorted in increasing order THIS IS THE CORRECT ANSWER(TC here will be O(n))
// When the array is sorted partially
// When the array is sorted in decreasing order.
// When the array is nearly sorted.
